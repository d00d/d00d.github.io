### Data Operations and Analytics
 Today's Digital organizations produces vast amounts of data for which analysis remains a challenge requiring innovative solutions to ensure data assets can be efficiently analyzed and better understand to receal customer preferences, market intelligence, operational & strategic insights.  Modern data management architectures have evolved from the traditional data warehousing model to more complex architectures that address more requirements, such as real-time & batch processing; structured and unstructured data;  high-velocity transactions; and operational intelligence.  Analyzing large data sets requires significant compute capacity that can vary in size based on the amount of input data and the type of analysis. This characteristic of big data workloads is ideally suited to modern cloud infrastructure, where applications can easily scale up and down based on demand.

### AIOps & DataOps
Accelerate time-to-value while de-risking analytics projects with efficent data / AI operations.  One-off analytic solutions implemented to address a specific business need but not properly “operationalized” precludes wider re-use across organizations.  We'll help create & reuse effective, predictive, and relevant analytic models.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Our extensive knowledge of the AWS technology suite, coupled with our tight partnership with AWS and our years of experience, means we can help you make the most of your AWS investment.

### Cloud Transformation
Operational transformation is achieved by adopting an efficient, scalable and secure platform along with support for process and cultural changes. The cloud adoption process is a journey starting with discovery and design.

### Cloud Managed DevOps
Using DevOps to run Enterprise Production environments is a huge shift away from the traditional approach. The change requires a transformed platform and experienced DevOps capability to realise the full benefits. We can help in defining and architecting AWS Big Data services so they fit into your data life cycle of collection, ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization.


### Software & Data Integration
