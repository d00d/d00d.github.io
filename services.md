### Data Operations and Analytics
 Today's Digital organizations produce vast quantities of data for which analysis remains a challenge requiring innovative solutions to ensure these valuable data assets can be efficiently analyzed and better understand to reveal customer preferences, market intelligence, operational & strategic insights.  Modern data management architectures have evolved from the traditional data warehousing to more complex architectures enable real-time & batch processing; high-velocity transactions; operational intelligence, and advanced techniques for decision support.  Analyzing large data sets requires significant compute capacity that can vary in size based on the amount of input data and the type of analysis. This characteristic of big data workloads is ideally suited to modern cloud infrastructure, where applications can easily scale up and down based on demand.

### AIOps & DataOps
Accelerate time-to-value while de-risking analytics projects with efficient data / AI operations.  One-off analytic solutions implemented to address a specific business need but not properly “operationalized” precludes wider re-use across organizations.  We'll help create & reuse effective, predictive, and relevant analytic models.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Implement core AWS Big Data services according to basic architecture best practices.  We can help you design and implement your cloud solution and help you make the most of your AWS investment.

### Cloud Transformation
Operational transformation is achieved by adopting an efficient, scalable and secure platform along with support for process and cultural changes. The cloud adoption process is a journey starting with discovery and design.

### Cloud Managed DevOps
Using DevOps to run Enterprise Production environments is a huge shift away from the traditional approach. The change requires a transformed platform and experienced DevOps capability to realize the full benefits. We can help in defining and architecting AWS Big Data services so they fit into your data life cycle of collection, ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization.

### Software & Data Integration
Your data is growing in volume and complexity. The question is, how are you keeping up?  We can help deliver faster, more secure, and impactful software applications. If your organization has many different sources of data and its not clear how to organize, connect, and optimize it, or you’re a software company who wants to deliver new features faster and reduce risk by practicing continuous integration & delivery in the cloud.  The TCO benefit of paying only for the infrastructure needed can help you to achieve continuous cost-optimization.
