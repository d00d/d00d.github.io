<p>Recommender Systems are increasingly everywhere.  Like it or not, this omnipresent branch of A.I. is embedded into our our lives.  Modern commercial applications leverage these information filtering predictors that are are all about us.   Whether product recommenders at Amazon, content recommenders for Twitter, or as playlist generators for the like video/audio likes of Netflix, YouTube &amp; Spotify recommender systems are one of the most successful applications of machine learning.</p>

<p>These systems are generally used to, as accurately as possible, automate consumer preference selection and thereby accrue value to user and provider alike.</p>

<h3 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h3>

<p>Machine learning algorithms in recommender systems are typically classified into two categories — content based and collaborative filtering methods although modern recommenders combine both approaches</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream" target="_blank">Deep Dream</a> is a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alex Mordvintsev which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images.  The resulting algorithmic pareidolia produces facinating images having a dream-like, kind of hallucinogenic appearance.</p>

<p>Depending on how models are developed this can rely on every area of the natural sciences and has applications in architecture, digital fabrication, art, engineering, biomedicine, etc.  In general, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) reflect a connectivity pattern manifest among neurons.  This resembles how the visual cortex functions from biology.  Inspired by nature, CNNs exploit local correlations and have significantly progressed fields of speech and image classification.</p>

<p>This generative progression is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_morphogenesis" target="_blank">digital morphogenesis</a> allowing us to synthesize visual textures and recognize patterns.  This technique relfects a kind of digital confirmation bias existing wthin the computational model where emergent patterns depend on the variety of subjects the model was trained with and the layers of the model we filter.</p>

<p>These very useful tools are built upon well-known mathematical methods, we actually understand surprisingly little of why certain models work and others don’t. So let’s take a look at some simple techniques for peeking inside these networks.  Computer Vision, Facial Recognition, and Speech Recognition, Self-driving cars are types of applications abound.</p>

<p>Artificial neural networks are trained via millions of training examples and gradually adjusting the network parameters until it gives the desired classification.  A network typically consists of 10-30 stacked layers of artificial neurons. Any given image is fed into the input layer, which then talks to the next layer, until eventually the “output” layer is reached. The network’s “answer” comes from its final output layer.</p>

<p>It remains a challenge to understand exactly what is going on at each layer. We know that after training, each layer progressively extracts higher and higher-level features of the image, until the final layer essentially makes a decision on what the image shows. For example, the first layer maybe looks for edges or corners. Intermediate layers interpret the basic features to look for overall shapes or components, like a door or a leaf. The final few layers assemble those into complete interpretations—these neurons activate in response to very complex things such as entire buildings or trees.</p>

<h3 id="producing-dreams">Producing Dreams</h3>

<p>Looking at Deep Dream, we have a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alex Mordvintsev that takes advantage of convolutional neural networks to recgonize and augment patterns in images, creating some amazing Dream-like hallucinogenic appearances in the deliberately over-processed images.</p>

<p>The concept of pareidolia is to interpret a vague stimulus as something known to the observer, such as seeing shapes in clouds, seeing faces in inanimate objects or abstract patterns, or hearing hidden messages in music.</p>

<p>algorithmic</p>

<p>Making the “dream” images is very simple. Essentially it is just a gradient ascent process that tries to maximize the L2 norm of activations of a particular DNN layer. Here are a few simple tricks that we found useful for getting good images:</p>

<p>offset image by a random jitter
normalize the magnitude of gradient ascent steps
apply ascent across multiple scales (octaves)
First we implement a basic gradient ascent step function, applying the first two tricks. Next we implement an ascent through different scales. We call these scales “octaves”.  Now we are ready to let the neural network to reveal its dreams! Let’s take a our site logo image as a starting point:</p>

<p>Running the next code cell starts the detail generation process. You may see how new patterns start to form, iteration by iteration, octave by octave.
The complexity of the details generated depends on which layer’s activations we try to maximize. Higher layers produce complex features, while lower ones enhance edges and textures, giving the image an impressionist feeling.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog-cnn/input.jpg" alt="input0.jpeg" />
<img src="/assets/img/blog-cnn/input0.jpeg" alt="input0.jpeg" />
<img src="/assets/img/blog-cnn/input_color1.jpeg" alt="input0.jpeg" /></p>

<p>What if we feed the deepdream function its own output, after applying a little zoom to it? It turns out that this leads to an endless stream of impressions of the things that the network saw during training. Some patterns fire more often than others, suggestive of basins of attraction.</p>

<p>We will start the process from the site logo image as above, but after some iteration the original image becomes irrelevant; even random noise can be used as the starting point.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog-cnn/input1.jpeg" alt="input0.jpeg" />
<img src="/assets/img/blog-cnn/input6a.jpeg" alt="input0.jpeg" />
<img src="/assets/img/blog-cnn/input16xxx.jpeg" alt="input0.jpeg" /></p>

<p>So here’s one surprise: neural networks that were trained to discriminate between different kinds of images have quite a bit of the information needed to
generate
images too. Check out some more examples across different classes:</p>

<p>Why is this important? Well, we train networks by simply showing them many examples of what we want them to learn, hoping they extract the essence of the matter at hand (e.g., a fork needs a handle and 2-4 tines), and learn to ignore what doesn’t matter (a fork can be any shape, size, color or orientation). But how do you check that the network has correctly learned the right features? It can help to visualize the network’s representation of a fork.</p>

<p>Indeed, in some cases, this reveals that the neural net isn’t quite looking for the thing we thought it was. For example, here’s what one neural net we designed thought dumbbells looked like:</p>

<p>There are dumbbells in there alright, but it seems no picture of a dumbbell is complete without a muscular weightlifter there to lift them. In this case, the network failed to completely distill the essence of a dumbbell. Maybe it’s never been shown a dumbbell without an arm holding it. Visualization can help us correct these kinds of training mishaps.</p>

<p>Instead of exactly prescribing which feature we want the network to amplify, we can also let the network make that decision. In this case we simply feed the network an arbitrary image or photo and let the network analyze the picture. We then pick a layer and ask the network to enhance whatever it detected. Each layer of the network deals with features at a different level of abstraction, so the complexity of features we generate depends on which layer we choose to enhance. For example, lower layers tend to produce strokes or simple ornament-like patterns, because those layers are sensitive to basic features such as edges and their orientations.</p>

<p>Left: Original photo by Zachi Evenor. Right: processed by Günther Noack, Software Engineer</p>

<p>Left: Original painting by Georges Seurat. Right: processed images by Matthew McNaughton, Software Engineer
If we choose higher-level layers, which identify more sophisticated features in images, complex features or even whole objects tend to emerge. Again, we just start with an existing image and give it to our neural net. We ask the network: “Whatever you see there, I want more of it!” This creates a feedback loop: if a cloud looks a little bit like a bird, the network will make it look more like a bird. This in turn will make the network recognize the bird even more strongly on the next pass and so forth, until a highly detailed bird appears, seemingly out of nowhere.</p>

<p>The results are intriguing—even a relatively simple neural network can be used to over-interpret an image, just like as children we enjoyed watching clouds and interpreting the random shapes. This network was trained mostly on images of animals, so naturally it tends to interpret shapes as animals. But because the data is stored at such a high abstraction, the results are an interesting remix of these learned features.</p>

<p>Of course, we can do more than cloud watching with this technique. We can apply it to any kind of image. The results vary quite a bit with the kind of image, because the features that are entered bias the network towards certain interpretations. For example, horizon lines tend to get filled with towers and pagodas. Rocks and trees turn into buildings. Birds and insects appear in images of leaves.</p>

<p>The original image influences what kind of objects form in the processed image.
This technique gives us a qualitative sense of the level of abstraction that a particular layer has achieved in its understanding of images. We call this technique “Inceptionism” in reference to the neural net architecture used. See our Inceptionism gallery for more pairs of images and their processed results, plus some cool video animations.</p>

<p>We must go deeper: Iterations</p>

<p>If we apply the algorithm iteratively on its own outputs and apply some zooming after each iteration, we get an endless stream of new impressions, exploring the set of things the network knows about. We can even start this process from a random-noise image, so that the result becomes purely the result of the neural network, as seen in the following images:</p>

<p>Neural net “dreams”— generated purely from random noise, using a network trained on places by MIT Computer Science and AI Laboratory. See our Inceptionism gallery for hi-res versions of the images above and more (Images marked “Places205-GoogLeNet” were made using this network).</p>

<p>The techniques presented here help us understand and visualize how neural networks are able to carry out difficult classification tasks, improve network architecture, and check what the network has learned during training. It also makes us wonder whether neural networks could become a tool for artists—a new way to remix visual concepts—or perhaps even shed a little light on the roots of the creative process in general.</p>

        <!-- <p><h2 id="factor-models--risk-exposure">Factor Models &amp; Risk Exposure</h2>
<p>One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle" title="first principles">first principles</a> underlying Financial market dynamics concerns the relationship between Risk &amp; Return.</p>

<p>As investment managers reach for ways to price assets, quantify investment risks, explain performance, and construct portfolios to achieve premiums above market returns, the use of quantitative models have become en vogue.</p>

<p>Factors and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multifactor-model.asp" title="Multi-Factor Models">factor-based models</a> provide some utility in explaining market equilibrium asset prices, decomposing risk and then re-recombine assets with these factors within a portfolio to specifically targeted risk profiles.  Having a scheme to isolate characteristics influenced by economic catalysts has a variety of applications including: risk-management, investment product development, strategic asset allocation, and portfolio construction.</p>

<p><strong>What are Factors?</strong></p>

<p>Factors can be viewed as the underlying characteristics within stocks and other securities, which to varying degrees,  explain and determine their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp" title="risk premium">risk premium</a>.</p>

<p>There are a wide variety of factors which associate with an asset’s expected returns.   There are <em>macroeconomic factors</em> which capture broad risks across asset classes such as credit, inflation, and liquidity.   There are <em>style factors</em> which look to explain returns and risks within asset classes such as value, quality, and momentum.  Literally hundreds of such factors have been identified and published since researchers <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/f/eugene-f-fama" title="Eugene Fama">Eugene Fama </a>and <a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/biography.html" title="Kenneth French">Kenneth French</a> introduced their classic <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/famaandfrenchthreefactormodel.asp" title="3-factor model">three-factor model</a>, consisting of market risk, size, and value, in 1993. </p>

<p>Factors have become a factor in the investment business where industry-aligned benchmark providers like FTSE Russell, MSCI, and S&amp;P Dow Jones have generated volumes of research and indexes supporting an expanding collection of newly-minted factors.  Over the last few years the use of factors has enabled development of smart beta products generating significant new fund flows.  <em><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta.asp" title="Smart Beta">smart beta</a></em>  and factor investing are just fashionable marketing labels for a wide range of risk-based approaches that sit somewhere beyond active and passive investment management but possess attributes of both.  Applications for factors is common in quantitative finance where quants may rank stocks by using a combination of fundamental factors and price-based factors for use in cross-sectional equity models or various methods of performance attribution.</p>

<p>The evolution of risk measurement and factor-based models can be understood in historical context through the evolution of prior asset models like <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp" title="CAPM">CAPM</a> and the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apt.asp" title="APT">APT</a>.</p>

<h3 id="capms-uber-factor">CAPM’s Uber-Factor</h3>

<p>In 1990, Bill Sharpe shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for his contributions on a theory of price formation for financial assets, this is the so-called Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).   This was the first theory to measure systematic risk which, according to the CAPM, depends only upon exposure to the market.</p>

<p>As with many models, CAPM  is a bit of a Faustian bargain in terms of explaining individual stock returns in terms of idiosyncratic / company-specific forces which tend to cancel each other within well-diversified portfolios.   However, CAPM holds that even these diversified portfolios are not ‘risk-free’ given their exposure to a <em>single</em> type of systemic risk known as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketrisk.asp" title="market risk">market risk</a>.</p>

<p>This market risk cannot be diversified away due to the pervasive influence of wider common economic forces.  Further it is the very degree of this exposure that is considered to be the source of expected return.  This market risk explains the variability of an asset’s rate of return relative to that of the overall market <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This single-factor market risk is measured by its <strong>beta $ \beta $</strong> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> which reflects a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/linearrelationship.asp" title="Linear Relationship">linear relationship</a> between an investment’s rate return relative to the market’s rate of return.</p>

<p>CAPM assumes a positive <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence" title="Correlation">correlation</a> between the amount of market exposure and the degree to which  for return.  In the “efficient” marketplace,  an investor could expect to ramp up the rate of return, by exposing a well-diversified portfolio to higher market risk.   In this scenario the variability of an asset’s rate of return is relative to that of the overall market and its “beta” provides a relative measure of systematic (market) risk.</p>

<p>Drinking the CAPM Kool-Aid has meant accepting that price movements are attributed to a single, relatively-simple statistical measure (systemic risk).   This model has been favored by many in academia, perhaps given the tempting simplicity and teach-ability.  However, for all its ivory tower appeal it seems this one trick pony doesn’t fully explain the cross section of stock returns.</p>

<p>Needing a scheme to deal with various relationships looking beyond this single-factor market beta brings us to a <em>multivariate</em> approach as introduced by the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apt.asp" title="APT">Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="multi-factor-arbitrage-pricing-theory-apt">Multi-Factor Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Ross_(economist)" title="Stephen A. Ross">Stephen A. Ross</a> was one of the first to look beyond “the market factor” while still focusing on systemic risk.  APT is more general than the CAPM, it accepts a variety of different risk sources as it recognizes the interaction of many factors (e.g. inflation, interest rates, business activity, etc.) as contributing to rates of return.  Assets have risk exposures (betas) with respect to each of these systematic risks.  These risk exposures are rewarded in the market with additional expected return, and thus the aggregate risk exposure profile explains volatility and performance of the well-diversified portfolio</p>

<p>Multi-factor model math is slightly more complex but still in a common linear model with an underlying concept more intuitively satisfying.   APT facilitates multi-factor analysis of many broad risk factors and to estimate individual securities’ degree of exposure to these factors to explain the so-called “cross-section” of returns at a given point in time.</p>

<p>Models with APT a security effectively has a sensitivity to each systematic risk factor. A series of beta coefficients are estimated to measure the sensitivity to the respective factor risks for a particular security.   Unlike the CAPM, however, the individual factors, although precisely quantified, are not specifically associated with readily identifiable variables.</p>

<p>Factor models offer a useful extension of the CAPM &amp; APT since they help us understand how key factors influence portfolio risk &amp; return.   This affords us an opportunity predict and control investment risk</p>

<p>Factor models extend the framework of existing asset pricing models and allow us to decompose portfolios by constituent factor sensitivities and help us understand attributes that influence portfolio returns.   The mathematical representation of factor models are extensible, linear, and offer a high degree of transparent interpretability which lend them some intuitive appeal.</p>

<h3 id="factors--arbitrage-pricing-theory-apt-relationship">Factors &amp; Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) relationship</h3>
<p>For any given time period ($\bf t$), the difference between realized return $\bf r_i(t)$ and the expected return $\bf Er_i(t)$ for any asset is equal to the sum of all risk factor exposures (e.g. betas  $\bf \beta$) multiplied by the realization (the actual end-of-period value) for that risk factor $\bf \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^k \beta_{i} [P_i+f_i(t)] $ , plus an asset-specific idiosyncratic) error term $\bf \epsilon_i(t)$ .</p>

<p>$\bf  E[r_i(t)] = P_0 + \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^k \beta_{i}P_i $ 
$\bf P_i$ is the price of risk, or the risk premium for the  $\bf j^{th} $ risk factor.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>$\bf r_i(t)$ = the total return on asset i (cap gains + dividends) realized at the end of period  $\bf t$</li>
  <li>$\bf E[r_i(t)]$ = expected return, at the beginning of period t</li>
  <li>$\bf P_0$ = risk free risk premium</li>
  <li>$\bf P_i$ = price of risk -or- risk premium for the $\bf i^{th}$ risk factor</li>
  <li>$f_i(t)$ = $\bf i^{th}$ risk factor at time $\bf t$.</li>
  <li>$ \beta_{i}P_i+ f_i $</li>
</ul>

<p>$\bf r_i(t) - P_0 = \beta_{i1} [P_1+ f_1(t)] + … + \beta_{iK} [P_K+f_K(t)] + \epsilon_i(t)$</p>

<p>Beta exposures within a portfolio provide control over associated risk premiums  providing a scheme to manage inherent risk-return trade-offs.   Control the risk exposures and control the risk-return relationship.</p>

<h3 id="estimating-an-apt-model">Estimating an APT model:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The risk factors f,(t), f,(t), …,fK(t) can be computed using statistical techniques such as factor analysis or principal components.</li>
  <li>K different well-diversified portfolios can substitute for the factors (see Appendix B).</li>
  <li>Economic theory and knowledge of financial markets can be used to specify K risk factors that can be measured from available macroeconomic and financial data.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="factor-rotation---a-nod-to-mean-reversion">Factor Rotation - a nod to mean reversion</h3>

<p>The CAPM is clear about the source of risk (the market) but suffers because no practical measure of the market exists. The APT causes difficulties because it does not identify the number of important factors or define them.   The statistical process of factor analysis is employed to quantify the broad risk factors and to estimate individual securities’ degree of exposure to these factors.</p>

<p>Financial researchers and investment managers undoubtedly agree that only a few important factors explain an overwhelming degree of investment risk and return. Therefore, the appeal of factor models that define these factors becomes apparent.</p>

<p>Factors can be used to  to avoid large chunks of the market and then build more differentiated portfolios of stocks with only the best overall factor profiles.   While not as scaleable as smart beta, this alpha-oriented approach has led to much better results for investors.</p>

<p>According to a factor model, the return-generating process for a security is driven by the presence of the various common factors and the security’s unique sensitivities to each factor (factor loadings). The common factors may be readily identifiable fundamental factors such as price-earnings ratio, size, yield, and growth.</p>

<p>A security effectively has a sensitivity to each systematic risk factor. A series of beta coefficients are estimated to measure the sensitivity to the respective factor risks for a particular security. Unlike the CAPM, however, the individual factors, although precisely quantified, are not specifically associated with readily identifiable variables.</p>

<p>Although considerable discussion continues about the number and the identification of these broad factors, the APT nevertheless provides investment managers with a valuable risk-management tool.</p>

<p>A good portfolio manager, whether explicitly or implicitly, evaluates the impact of a series of broad factors on the performances of various securities. In this sense, a reliable factor model provides a valuable tool to assist portfolio managers with the identification of pervasive factors that affect large members of securities.</p>

<p>Factor models can be used to decompose 
portfolio risk according to common factor exposure and to evaluate how much of a portfolio’s return was attributable to each common factor exposure. Consequently, factor models offer a useful extension of the CAPM and the APT because they advance our understanding about how key factors influence portfolio risk and return.</p>

<p>Sharpe (1984) effectively summarizes why investment professionals should pay heed to factor models:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>While the relative importance of various actors changes over time, as do the preferences of investors, we need not completely abandon a valuable framework within which we can approach investment decisions methodically. We have developed a useful set of tools and should certainly continue to develop them. Meanwhile, we can use the tools we have, as long as we use them intelligently, cautiously, and humbly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The objective being select exposures to key factors that represents the best trade-off between risk taken and risk prem expected to be earned. To arrive at this result, we need to answer several questions, such as how to deﬁne the key risk factors driving returns; how to measure and estimate risk and risk premia; how to use these estimates to construct an optimal portfolio of risk exposures.  risk factor decomposition of asset returns, determinants o risk and risk premia, and optimal portfolio choice.</p>

<p>investors to replace optimal  asset allocation with optimal  risk factor allocation— a much more tractable exercise. We can then focus on the optimal alloc of a risk budget to key risk factors rather than directly on a large menu assets in ﬁnancial markets.</p>

<p>Principal components analysis is a statistical methodology useful for extracting the key driv - ers of a set of variables being studied. It reduces a collection of  N variables (e.g., changes in  riskless yields of N different maturities) to K factors (with K much smaller than  N), where  these factors (or principal components) capture most of the variation in the data. In par - ticular, the ﬁrst principal component (PC1) is a (normalized) linear combination of the  N  variables that has the maximum variance. The second principal component (PC2) is the (n - malized) linear combination of the underlying data that has the maximum variance among  all combinations that are uncorrelated with PC1, and so on. For a formal description, see  Campbell, Lo, and McKinley (1996, ch. 6).</p>

<p>We’re challeged by a world of increasing speed and complexity where the  implication of our decisions is growing and the time afforded to make them is shrinking.  The field of mathematics and computer science offer some useful models to help improve, expedite, and automate decision-making.  Given their unique value we should expect to find the models offering these mathematical intuitions increasingly embeded into our world.  As such it will be helpful to recognize them understand how they are being used.</p>

<p>Machine learning aims at automatic discovery of regularities in data using algorithms and by generalizing to new but similar data.  These are automations which rely on data analysis and inference to train models.  Once models are trained, they are applied for common classification and prediction tasks.</p>

<p>ML models are trained, not explicitly programmed, to perform a kind of statistical pattern match.   Utility of these models is highly dependent on the data from which they are derrived, quality of the data can be highly correlated to accuracy of predictions. The key is in teaching the machine learn what function best describes the data.  These basically result in something familiar to a linear model form of y=mx+b. Further that the data reflecting the real-world is required to make these work effectively.  The more high-quality data they processes, the more accurate and valuable these models become. </p>

<p>Machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, discover patterns, and and optimize for the best output making informed decisions based on what it has learned.  Music recommendations &amp; email filtering are common applications of this type of statistical prediction.  Machine learning becoming increasingly ubiquitous and given it lends itself to all manner of automation.</p>

<h3 id="neural-networks">Neural Networks</h3>
<p>Neural Networks have structures modeled after brains. deep learning algorithms which exist in layers, “artificial neural network”.  These neural networks have brought significant progress in areas such as speech recognition and image classification.</p>

<p>In computational networks an activation function produces the output for a node given a set of inputs.  effects results of the model.</p>

<p>Algorithmic Trading is a technique of deploying algorithms that automatically buy and sell stocks in response to market data.</p>

<h3 id="the-alpha-idea">The alpha idea</h3>
<p>At fallbrook we work the full lifecycle srom the first step in developing a trading algorithm is coming up with an “alpha idea” to iterating its implementation.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is alpha?</em></strong></p>

<p>Basically, the return of a portfolio can be written as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>r = beta * rm + alpha</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where beta measures the correlation of the portfolio return to the overall market return (r_ _m), and alpha is the excess return.</p>

<ol>
  <li>For instance, an index fund has alpha=0, beta=1. But, what I am really after is a positive non-zero alpha, which would indicate that my algorithm is doing better than the market, and at the same time beta=0, i.e. I want my algorithm to be independent form the market, “market-neutral”.</li>
</ol>

<p>To get started, I want to try the following alpha idea: Companies with a high revenue growth are doing well, and I want to invest in them. Companies with low revenue growth are doing poorly, and I want to short them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>•   Backtest on a larger timeframe.
	• Try adding more alpha factors.
	• Analyze alpha factor correlations.
	• Weight distribution: how to optimally weigh the factors? (this is currently one of the fields of active research, and a field where Machine Learning could help.)
	• Optimize trading behavior, e.g. the trading quantiles.
	• Analyze sector exposure.
	• etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>To summarize, the algorithmic trading workflow is this:
	1.  come up with an “alpha idea”
	2.  estimate alpha using alphalens
	3.  run full backtest on past market data
	4.  analyze the backtest using pyfolio</p>
