<p>Algorithmic Trading is a technique of deploying algorithms that automatically buy and sell stocks in response to market data.</p>

<h2 id="the-alpha-idea">The alpha idea</h2>
<p>At fallbrook we work the full lifecycle srom the first step in developing a trading algorithm is coming up with an “alpha idea” to iterating its implementation.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is alpha?</em></strong></p>

<p>Basically, the return of a portfolio can be written as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>r = beta * rm + alpha</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where beta measures the correlation of the portfolio return to the overall market return (r_ _m), and alpha is the excess return.</p>

<ol>
  <li>For instance, an index fund has alpha=0, beta=1. But, what I am really after is a positive non-zero alpha, which would indicate that my algorithm is doing better than the market, and at the same time beta=0, i.e. I want my algorithm to be independent form the market, “market-neutral”.</li>
</ol>

<p>To get started, I want to try the following alpha idea: Companies with a high revenue growth are doing well, and I want to invest in them. Companies with low revenue growth are doing poorly, and I want to short them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>•   Backtest on a larger timeframe.
	• Try adding more alpha factors.
	• Analyze alpha factor correlations.
	• Weight distribution: how to optimally weigh the factors? (this is currently one of the fields of active research, and a field where Machine Learning could help.)
	• Optimize trading behavior, e.g. the trading quantiles.
	• Analyze sector exposure.
	• etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>To summarize, the algorithmic trading workflow is this:
	1.  come up with an “alpha idea”
	2.  estimate alpha using alphalens
	3.  run full backtest on past market data
	4.  analyze the backtest using pyfolio</p>
