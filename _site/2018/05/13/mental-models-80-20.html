<p>Perhaps the most common and valuable mental model is 80/20 Rule. It is easy to understand, widely applicable, and creates amazing results.  The Rule (also known as Pareto’s Law, Zipf’s Principle of Least Effort, and Juran’s Law of The Vital Few) states that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A minority of inputs leads to a majority of outputs.</li>
  <li>A minority of causes create a majority of effects.</li>
  <li>A minority of efforts lead to a majority of results.</li>
</ul>

<p>This phenomena applies across many domains including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>productivity</li>
  <li>happiness</li>
  <li>business - health</li>
  <li>etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20% of relationships lead to 80% of happiness.</li>
  <li>20% of exercises lead to 80% of health benefit.</li>
  <li>20% of items on your to do list lead to 80% of productivity.</li>
</ul>
