  <h1>Machine Learning Models</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Machine learning is subset to Artificial Intelligence which borrows principles from computer science. It is not an AI though; It is focal point where business and experience meet emerging technology and decides to work together. ML also has very close relationship to statistics; which is a graphical branch of mathematics. It instructs an algorithm to learn for itself by analyzing data. The more data it processes, the smarter the algorithm gets.  Until only recently even though foundation was laid down in 1950 ML remained largely confined to academia.</p>

<p>ML has Organizations have had success with each type of learning, but making the right choice for your business problem requires an understanding of which conditions are best suited for each approach. Types of machine learning algorithms i.e. MLAlgos and which one to be used when is extremely important to know. The goal of the task and all the things that are being done in the field and put you in a better position to break down a real problem and design a machine learning system.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-machine-learning">Types of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Before we get into MLAlgos lets understand some basics here. The approach of developing ML includes learning from data inputs based on “What has happened”. Evaluating and optimising different model results remains focus here. As on date Machine Learning is widely used in data analytics as a method to develop algorithms for making predictions on data. It is related to probability, statistics, and linear algebra.
Machine Learning is classified into four categories at high level depending on the nature of the learning and learning system.  Some how I find difficult to accept Semi-supervised Learning.

<h2 id="3-major--1-non-major-types">3 Major + 1 Non Major Types</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Supervised learning: Supervised learning gets labelled inputs and their desired outputs. The goal is to learn a general rule to map inputs to the output.</li>
  <li>Unsupervised learning: Machine gets inputs without desired outputs, the goal is to find structure in inputs. </li>
  <li>Reinforcement learning: In this algorithm interacts with a dynamic environment, and it must perform a certain goal without guide or teacher.</li>
  <li>Semi-supervised Learning: This type of ml i.e. semi-supervised algorithms are the best candidates for the model building in the absence of labels for some data. So if data is mix of label and un-label then this can be the answer. Typically a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data is used here.</li>
</ul>
