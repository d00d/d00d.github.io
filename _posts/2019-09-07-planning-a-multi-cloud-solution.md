### Hybrid Architecture Potential

Planning a multi-cloud architecture is about leveraging more than a single public cloud. With a hybrid cloud, common or interconnected workloads are deployed across multiple computing environments and with multi-clouds setups will combine at least two public cloud providers and may include a private compute environment.

As typical of hybrid architectures, a multi-cloud can offer a choice of services, enable workload portability, and an opportunity to achive a *best of breed* solution. This potential adds complexity, cost, risk but has the potential to add higher value. If well-executed you can achieve a unified view of health, performance, and capacity management.

Because workloads, infrastructure, and processes are unique to each enterprise, your hybrid strategy has to be adapted to your specific needs.  The decision about which workloads to run on which compute environments has a material impact on the effectiveness of a multi-cloud strategy.

### Consider the trade-offs

Realize that multi-cloud may provide value in certain problem domains, certain scenarios with certain businesses but there are no guarantees and plenth of risks. The additional complexity is risk and may be a cost your solution doesn't need. Its important to realize that a multi-cloud architecture requires special management and monitoring.

It is common when leveraging different public multi-clouds, to encapsulate and abstract them behind management layers like cloud management platforms, cloud service brokers, and monitoring systems. This approach could shield your team from binding directly to vendor-specific core API's that are native to the particular cloud providers and allow for management via the proverbial *'single pane of glass'.*

### Cost & Strategic Advantage

It is very important to understand multi-cloud cost drivers. Multi-clouds will tend to be more expensive than a hybrid, public, or private-only cloud given the increased complexity and need for tools to manage it. That said, can enable best of breed options and increase the agility of your business to respond better to changing market demands

The most cost-effective option for a given solution may be possible among like cloud services. This is where potential lies to gain a strategic advantage by not being dependent or locked into a particular cloud brand.

When assessing this potential its important to understand and accurately model the relative costs and options.   Keeping your business case in focus to quantify costs, as well as the value, back to the business is important to define your terms of success.

### Implications for your Operating Model

Changing the operating model is probably the most difficult part of a multi-cloud transformation. The upside is well-articulated, if well-managed you may reduce IT operational costs. Thes operational savings are not just from the improved hardware and software efficiency but also from more effective use of staff,  leveraging automation, and having the tools needed to manage technology more efficiently. The key thing to remember is that it means working more closely with the business. It means an IT operating model that is services and software product-oriented, not technology- or project-oriented.

### Governance & Adoption

You should establish your multi-cloud future-state vision and draw a program roadmap to get there in terms of people, process and technology.   Hybrid and multi-cloud setups might be temporary, maintained only for a limited time to facilitate migration. However, these setups may also represent a strategic future state of your organization and adoption may a part of a larger modernization and digital transformation IT strategy.  Alignment your portfolio management process is an effective tactic to help identify candidate projects for cloud adoption and enforcing opt-outs on exception basis will help starve the data center may be looking to exit.
