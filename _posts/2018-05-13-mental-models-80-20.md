Perhaps the most common and valuable mental model is 80/20 Rule. It is easy to understand, widely applicable, and creates amazing results.  The Rule (also known as Pareto’s Law, Zipf’s Principle of Least Effort, and Juran’s Law of The Vital Few) states that:
- A minority of inputs leads to a majority of outputs.
- A minority of causes create a majority of effects.
- A minority of efforts lead to a majority of results.

#### This phenomena applies across many domains including:
- productivity
- happiness 
- business - health
- etc...

#### Here are a few examples:

- 20% of relationships lead to 80% of happiness.
- 20% of exercises lead to 80% of health benefit.
- 20% of items on your to do list lead to 80% of productivity.
