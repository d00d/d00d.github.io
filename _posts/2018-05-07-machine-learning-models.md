### Ubiqity of algorithmic intuition
We're challeged by a world of increasing speed and complexity where the  implication of our decisions is growing and the time afforded to make them is shrinking.  The field of mathematics and computer science offer some useful models to help improve, expedite, and automate decision-making.  Given their unique value we should expect to find the models offering these mathematical intuitions increasingly embeded into our world.  As such it will be helpful to recognize them understand how they are being used.

### Machine learning

A subset to Artificial Intelligence, this automation relies on data analysis and inference to train models which are applied for classification and prediction tasks.

It is not an AI but more of a statistical pattern matcher where a ML model's utility is correlated with quality of the data its training against. It is focal point where business and experience meet emerging technology and decides to work together.

It instructs an algorithm to learn for itself by analyzing data. The more data it processes, the smarter the algorithm gets.  Until only recently even though foundation was laid down in 1950 ML remained largely confined to academia.

Machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned.  Music recommendations & email filtering are common applications of this type of statistical prediction.  Machine learning becoming increasingly ubiquitous and given it lends itself to all manner of automation.

### Neural Networks
Neural Networks have structures modeled after brains. deep learning algorithms which exist in layers, “artificial neural network”.  These neural networks have brought significant progress in areas such as speech recognition and image classification.
